See some of my pictures from Chile below!\nI moved to the Netherlands in 2018 as a visiting PhD student at Erasmus University. In 2019, I started working at Universitat Pompeu Fabra.\nBefore starting my PhD, I worked as a financial trader for five years, handling interest and liquidity risk exposure in Itau Bank (formerly “Corpbanca”).\n\nChile\nHere is a selection of some places I would recommend to visit.
