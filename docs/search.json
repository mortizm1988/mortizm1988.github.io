When I wasn’t studying, I spent most of my weekends engaged in water sports, hiking, and photography.\nI moved to the Netherlands in 2018 as a visiting PhD student at Erasmus University. In 2019, I started working at Universitat Pompeu Fabra.\nBefore starting my PhD, I worked as a financial trader for five years, handling interest and liquidity risk exposure in Itau Bank (formerly “Corpbanca”)."
