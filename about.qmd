I grew up in Chile, between Viña del Mar and Santiago.

I studied for all my degrees at Universidad Adolfo Ibañez, first industrial engineering (undergraduate) and financial engineering (MSc), and then a PhD in Finance. Naturally, when not studying, I spent most of my weekends on the beach, lakes, and mountains. I like water sports, hiking, and photography.

I moved to the Netherlands in 2018 to visit Erasmus University, Rotterdam School of Management. Then,  in 2019, I moved to Barcelona and started working at Universitat Pompeu Fabra.
