I grew up in Chile, between Viña del Mar and Santiago.

I studied for all my degrees at Universidad Adolfo Ibañez, first industrial engineering (undergraduate) and financial engineering (MSc), and then a PhD in Finance. When not studying, I spent most of my weekends on the beach, lakes, rivers and montains. I like water sports, hiking, and photography. See some of my pictures from Chile below!

I moved to the Netherlands in 2018 as a visiting PhD student at Erasmus University. In 2019, I started working at Universitat Pompeu Fabra.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a financial trader for five years, handling interest and liquidity risk exposure in Itau Bank (formerly "Corpbanca").
