I grew up in Chile, moving around [Viña del Mar and Santiago](https://chile.travel/en/where-to-go/macrozone/central-chile-santiago-and-valparaiso/), an area renowned for its beautiful valleys, snowy mountains, and stunning coastline.

I completed all my degrees at Universidad Adolfo Ibañez, starting with an undergraduate degree in industrial engineering, followed by a Master of Science in Financial Engineering, and then a PhD in Finance. When I wasn't studying, I spent most of my weekends engaged in water sports, hiking, and photography.

I moved to the Netherlands in 2018 as a visiting PhD student at Erasmus University. In 2019, I started working at Universitat Pompeu Fabra.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a financial trader for five years, handling interest and liquidity risk exposure in Itau Bank (formerly "Corpbanca").
