I'm an Assistant Professor at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/en/web/universitat/la-upf-en-els-ranquings), affiliated with the Barcelona School of Economics and the Barcelona School of Management.

My research lies at the intersection of **Accounting** and **Corporate Governance.** I'm fortunate that my research has been published in leading journals, including three publications in journals of the FT 50 List.

I also hold a **Ramon y Cajal Fellowship** from the Spanish Ministry for Science and Innovation.

I co-organize the [Barcelona Accounting Summer Workshops](https://sites.google.com/view/bas-2021/inicio).
