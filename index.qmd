I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics and Business at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/en/web/universitat/la-upf-en-els-ranquings).

My research focuses on three main areas: Accounting, Corporate Governance, and Business Families.

I'm fortunate that my research has been published in leading finance and management journals such as **The Review of Financial Studies**, **Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice** (x2), and **Global Strategy Journal**.

Also, I'm an Affiliated Professor at the Barcelona School of Economics and the Barcelona School of Management, and have been a visiting scholar at Universit√© Paris Dauphine-PSL and Rotterdam School of Management.

I co-organize the [Barcelona Accounting Summer](https://sites.google.com/view/bas-2021/inicio) Seminars and Workshops.

My CV is available [here](cv_2024-06.pdf).
