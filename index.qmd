I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics and Business at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/en/web/universitat/la-upf-en-els-ranquings) since 2019.

My research focuses on three main areas: Accounting, Corporate Governance, and Business Families.

I'm fortunate that my research has been published in leading journals, including three publications in journals of the FT 50 List.

Also, I'm an Affiliated Professor at the Barcelona School of Economics and the Barcelona School of Management, and have been a visiting scholar at Universit√© Paris Dauphine-PSL and Rotterdam School of Management.

I co-organize the [Barcelona Accounting Summer](https://sites.google.com/view/bas-2021/inicio) Seminars and Workshops.

My CV is available [here](cv_2024-06.pdf).
